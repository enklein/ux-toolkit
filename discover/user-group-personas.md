# User Group Personas
Use User Group Personas to reference research insights about your primary user groups.

### The Problem with Most Personas
Too many user personas are built around presumptions about ideal 'types' of users and consumers, rather than data-driven reflections of the real groups of users who use the product. Operating on presumptions could drive the product or its updates in a direction away from some or most user needs.

*Make an actionable tool, not a presumptive design flex.*

## Keys to Effective Personas
In making user group personas (or any personas), keep these three points in mind:
1. **Use Data & Real Insights.** Review analytics data, interview users, and survey users. Gather real data and find verifiable pain points in your users' experiences with the product (or competitors).
2. **Design Fast.** Better understand users' goals, frustrations, and likes with a product or process. Document these quickly and move on.
3. **Skip the Fluff.** Use only what's important. If you want to add more, make sure it's important contextual information, rather than filler. You don't need a fake name, imaginary grandchildren, and their favorite app, but information on how they connect with the product to achieve their goals is valuable.

## Researching for Personas
There are a few simple methods you can use in researching for your personas:
- **Interview users.** Ideally 5 â€“ 30 users (with 5 or so per group) until you find fewer new insights in each new interview. Then **code the data**, categorizing it into major themes (Coding or Thematic Analysis).
- **Survey users.** This works especially well if you have a larger user group and an email chain. Sent out an email seeking people looking to help shape the product or looking to join a "special community of customers who have the opportunity to impact future changes to the product" (Aldritch). Consider asking about what they'd change and why, providing a list of content areas but limiting the number they can select to one or at most three.
- **Or Use Both.** Interview users to find main themes, then create a survey that will allow for collecting quantitative data on a larger scale.

## The Essentials: Working with the Template
I've provided my personal template below. Reformat the style to reflect the client's brand and find a visual that reflects the given user group on [unDraw](https://undraw.co/) or Pablo Stanley's [Humaaans](https://www.humaaans.com/) or [Open Doodles](https://www.opendoodles.com/), then define:
- **User Group**: What's their title or role?
- **Goal Statement**: What are they trying to achieve? Place them in context.
- **Pain Points**: What causes friction in their process or takes away from their experience with the product?
- **Pleasure Points**: Where are they saving time and enjoying the process?
