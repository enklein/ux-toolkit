# Stakeholder Interviews
Stakeholder interviews are designed to explore business goals and brand vision. Find five or so that are super-in-tune with the business and product. Prepare open ended questions that help for gathering info and keeping it conversational.

*Make sure to send the interview questions to stakeholders before conducting the interviews.*

**To learn more about:**
- Business objectives
- Revenue model
- User needs
- Technical limitations

**In helping achieve:**
- Guidance doc – this documents what we've learned and helps ensure we're aligned with stakeholders
- Stakeholder trust – easier to work with stakeholders/clients when they know their voice is being heard

**Stakeholder.** "A stakeholder is anyone within an organization who can offer useful advice about the product and ultimately help simplify the design process" (Fard).


## Tips & Tricks
**Tips from Fard (2019):**
- Pretend you know absolutely nothing.
- Leave your power suit at the door.
- Listen carefully and don’t interrupt.
- Close silence gaps by rewording questions.
- Insist on getting into details.

**Questions from Brown (2018):**
- Describe the purpose of this project in your own words.
- What's the most important thing for us to get right?
- How would you characterize the target audience?
- If you could ask users one thing, what would it be?
- How will you know if this is successful?
