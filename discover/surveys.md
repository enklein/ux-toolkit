# User Surveys
Use qualitative and quantitative user surveys to efficiently gather data about your users.

## Preparing the Survey
- **Research Beforehand.** Conduct some qualitative research before hand through something like [User Interviews](user-interviews.md) to ensure you understand enough of the problem to provide the right options and to best-orient the questions.
- **The Questions.** Use closed or open questions, keep them complete and simple. Avoid unbalanced scales and leading questions (ones that nudge respondents towards answering in a certain direction.) Be careful of priming.
    - **Closed Questions.** Yes/no, multiple choice, checkboxes, Likert scale questions. Higher response rates. Quantitative data.
    - **Open Questions.** Short essay/commentary questions. Much better qualitative data. Time cost to analyze.
- **Getting Participants**. Or keeping them.
    - **Length.** Make sure every question is worth it. Length is a key factor in response rate. Show progress when possible.
    - **Structure.** Structure your survey in a way that minimizes the number of people dropping out. Ask basic questions at the beginning, get to more complex questions in the middle, and close with general questions at the end. (Alternatively, if your survey can record dropped-entries, structure with the most important up front.)
    - **Incentives.** Use incentives to increase your response rate (and also the quality of data), cautiously. It can get expensive with a higher number of participants, and incentives can sometimes influence respondents to answer more positively (bias).
    - **Selection.** Avoid selection bias by making sure the survey respondents are a reasonable cross section of the population you're trying to measure. Try to [check for and correct](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/12-539-x/2009001/response-reponse-eng.htm) nonresponse bias.
- **Test** the survey before hand and **get approval** by stakeholders before releasing it.

## Evaluation
Evaluate and analyze the data. Consider coding your responses in organizing qualitative survey data. Document results.
