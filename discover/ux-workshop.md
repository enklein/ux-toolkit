## Preparing for Workshops
Workshops require getting the team together and involving them in shared activities:
- **Define participant roles.** Delegate tasks to others as needed to help avoid slowdowns and surprises. You need at least a facilitator, and an assistant (local) helps.
    - The **Facilitator** runs the show, managing the workshop collaboration and timing, setting the pace for activities, and keeping everyone engaged. Serve the team and stay active.
    - The **Local Assistant** is someone on-site who can contribute along with the rest of the team that also helps take care of logistics: booking a conference room, scheduling the workshop, arranging the room and tech, gathering materials, and helping run the workshop.
- **Set up the Room, Tech, and Materials.** Prevent slowdowns due to tech or missing materials early, whether the workshop is remote or in-person. Make sure to have a stable connection (and a backup if possible), a well-lit room, appropriate video conferencing equipment, and the right collaboration software.
- **Be Realistic and a Team Player.** Plan ahead with the local assistant and decide which workshop techniques and tools you need to use to achieve the results you want to achieve. Explain the techniques, calculate the time required, schedule breaks, and plan time for fixing technical problems.

## During the Workshop
- **Balance Digital and Physical Tools.** Choose which to lead with, with the goal being keeping the ideation and generation flowing smoothly.
    - **Non-Digital.** If you lead with non-digital tools, make sure the team is mostly in-person, and take advantage of the speed and freedom of content from sketches and post-its etc. Make sure to archive everything (take photos!).
    - **Digital.** LEad with digital if the team is mostly remote or distributed: keep everything easily accessible, edit and reorganize content quickly, and use the right tools for the job. (Online virtual boards include Realtimeboard, Muraly, or Sketchboard.)
- *Sometimes a shared spreadsheet can work just as well as a wall of sticky notes.* (This is great, too, if participants are voting on things.)
- **Speed up the work with templates.** Have it all ready before the workshop starts: prefilled documents, virtual boards, etc. 

## Example One-Day Design Workshop from Rosemberg
1. Empathizing. Present user research results (keynote/ google slides) and do an empathy map (virtual whiteboard).
2. Problem Framing. Brainstorm (virtual whiteboard or spreadsheet) and complete an affinity diagram (virtual whiteboard or spreadsheet).
3. Ideation. Brainstorming (shared spreadsheet) and prioritizing (voting via spreadsheet).
4. Prototyping. Sketching (pen+paper, taking pictures, sharing them in a virtual whiteboard or group messaging app). Choosing the best ideas (dot voting on a virtual whiteboard).

## After the Workshop
- **Get Feedback, Evaluate, and Improve.** Identify areas that can be improved. Ideally right after the workshop while everything is fresh. Prepare a short, anonymous online survey before the workshop, send it to participants right after, and track each aspect separately (equipment, communications, remote tech, software, duration, etc.), and let the team leave comments.
- **Take care of digital artifacts.** Use the tools you created to drive discussion and other workshops.
    - **Create a repo.** An organized repository of the workshop, centralized and accessible for the team. Link to any virtual boards or external sources used as needed.
    - **Make sure core artifacts are complete.** (Sketches, spreadsheets, virtual boards, etc.) When it isn't possible to finish during the workshop, if you think its useful in the future, do it as soon as possible once the workshop is over.

## Workshop Activities (Resources)
The best workshop activities list comes from Sarah Gibbons at Nielsen Norman Group's [*Foundational UX Workshop Activities*](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/workshop-activities/). Check out the article to read the Why, When, and Tips for each activity. This resource covers seven:
1. **Post up.** Participants generate content on sticky notes and post them up on a wall.
2. **Affinity diagramming.** Participants cluster information (often on sticky notes) in relational groups based on similarities/themes.
3. **Landscape mapping.** Participants arrange groups of similar content (often on sticky notes) into a preassigned structure (like a journey map).
4. **Storyboarding.** Participants communicate a story through images displayed in a sequence of panels that chronologically map the story's main events.
5. **Forced Ranking.** Participants prioritize items, directly weighing them against each other in order to create a strict order.
6. **Role playing.** Participants act out another perspective or system as a technique for exploration and discovery.
7. **Playback.** Participants share progress, process, or insights gained by an individual (or subgroup) in a broad group, formally or informally.
