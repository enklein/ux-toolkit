# User Interviews
Use User Interviews to get insights into what users think about a product/process to inform personas, journey maps, and upcoming design work.

## How to Conduct a User Interview
- **Set a goal** based on stakeholder goals/needs. Keep it concrete and specific.
- **Make the user feel comfortable.** Meet with them before, explain the reason for the interview and how the data will be used, make sure they feel heard and that they can take their time. Ask related questions to build empathy, starting with easy questions about what they do in their spare time, perhaps.
- **Prepare questions beforehand.** Bring the list to the interview, but get the team's feedback before using them. Be clear, non-leading, and open-ended with questions.
- **Anticipate different responses** and have follow up questions based on research goals.
- **Don't ask what they want.** Users don't know and aren't designers. Identify problems so the team can build the solution.
- **Never mention other users.** Ask about their unique experiences/perceptions, rather than priming them to think in the context of their peers (or worse, self-measure against peers or assume you are asking them to).
- **Drop questions as needed.** If some questions don't work, drop them, especially if they're eliciting a negative reaction.

## Not a Usability Test
While User Interviews have qualities in common with Usability Tests, they have their differences.
- Interviews don't require a design or interactive material.
- User data is more about perceptions than behavioral insights.
- Some data is self reported (shared quality).
- The participant must talk a lot for the research to be effective (not always required for usability tests).
- Facilitators/interviews should maintain normal eye contact with the user as they would in any conversation (while usability-test facilitators avoid the user's direct line of vision and often sit behind or beside the user).
- Facilitators should create a friendly/strong report with the participant, but in usability tests the facilitator should fade into the background more.
