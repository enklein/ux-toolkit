# UX Process Toolkit
This Toolkit follows three crucial points in the UX/UI process: Discover, Define, and Design. Each step is designed to inform the work done in the steps that follow: Discovery provides all information needed to Define the problem and intended solution which we then Design and polish so that it can be later Developed. Pick and choose the tools that best suit your project's needs, budget, and timeline.

**Author.** This Toolkit is authored and maintained by Zach Ryan aka Enklein to aid the UX/UI process for any that use it.

**Updates.** Incremental updates made to this toolkit will include an overview/notes page for each item under "Tools & Deliverables" sections.

**Issues.** If you catch any errors in content or copy, please let me know at mrztryan@gmail.com or create a pull request.


## Discover
The goal of this step is to inform the design process and its direction.
* Business: What is the business trying to achieve? What is its culture and brand identity like?
* Users: Who are the users? What are their needs, goals, etc.? In what context do they use the product?
* Measure: How is the product doing at the moment? What are its strongest and weakest points? 
* Plan: How do we measure the success of this product and our design process? What KPIs should we keep up with?

**Tools & Deliverables**
* [Stakeholder Interviews](discover/stakeholder-interviews.md)
* [User Interviews](discover/user-interviews.md)
* [User Group Personas](discover/user-group-personas.md)
* [Workshops](discover/ux-workshop.md)
* [User Surveys](discover/surveys.md)
* Analytics
* Competitive Analysis
* UX Audit, may include or focus on:
    * Analytics Evaluation
    * Competitive Analysis
    * User Testing of current product or competitors' products
    * Heuristic Evaluation

*Optional opportunity to draft a report for stakeholders with the results of this phase including copies of any deliverables.*


## Define
* For an existing product — map the path users take with the product to achieve their goal and find and plan for areas for improvement. For a new product — identify similar paths with competitors' products and solve problems they have or map out an informed potential path for users with the new product.
* Define any new features or improvements as well as the layout and architecture for the new product or updates.

**Tools & Deliverables**
* User Stories
* User Story Maps
* App Flows
* Journey Maps
* Scenario Maps
* Card Sorting
* Sitemap

**Testing, Validation, & Delivery**
* Test content/organization via user flows testing, card sorting.
* Review the architecture, deliverables, etc. for approval and to ensure alignment between UX efforts and business goals.

*Optional opportunity to draft a report for stakeholders with the results of this phase including copies of any deliverables.*


## Design
### Low-Fi
While the Define stage identifies and plans major points in the user journey, the Design stage better realizes its steps, interactions, and transitions.

**Tools & Deliverables**
* Wireframes
* Wire flows
* Interaction maps (separate from or combined with wireframes)
* Paper wireframing
* Wireframe or paper prototyping

**Testing, Validation, & Delivery**
* User testing with flows, frames, and prototypes.

*Optional opportunity to draft a report for stakeholders with the results of this phase including copies of any deliverables.*

### High-Fi
Polish the design and provide any necessary documentation.

**Tools & Deliverables**
- UI Mockups
- Updated flow, interaction maps
- High-fi prototypes
- UI/Brand Guidelines +/- Design Library
    * Initial or Updated Release
    * Includes type, iconography, colors, etc.

*Optional opportunity to draft a report for stakeholders with the results of this phase including copies of any deliverables.*
